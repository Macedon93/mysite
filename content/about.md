I'm a 27 year old jr Data Scientist & Data engineer pursuing my masters in Data Science.  

My interests are primarily in statistical learning theory, probabalistic generative models, machine learning 
algorithms and their optimization, data mining and database design. Im currently trying to get my foot in the door 
for my first post bac job.

I will be entering the Data Science MSc program at Montclair State University in September 2020.
