I'm a 27 year old jr Data Scientist & jr Data Engineer pursuing my 
masters in Data Science and Statistics.

My interests are primarily in statistical learning theory, 
probabilistic generative models, machine learning 
algorithms/optimization, data mining and database design. I'm 
currently trying to get my foot in the door for my first post bac job.

I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL. I'm most comfortable using R for 
statistical analyses and Python for training ML models. I'm currently
getting the hang of putting these models into production using scikitLearn.  

I will be entering the Data Science MSc program at Montclair State University in September 2020.
