My names Steve. 

My professional interests are primarily in statistical learning theory, machine learning 
algorithms and their optimization, data mining and general data analysis. Im currently trying to get my foot in the door 
for my first post bac job. I will be entering the Data Science masters program at Montclair State this upcoming fall.
