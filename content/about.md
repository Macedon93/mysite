I'm a 27 year old jr Data Scientist & Data engineer pursuing my masters in Data Science.  

My interests are primarily in statistical learning theory, probabilistic generative models, machine learning 
algorithms/optimization, data mining and database design. Im currently trying to get my foot in the door 
for my first post bac job.

I will be entering the Data Science MSc program at Montclair State University in September 2020.
