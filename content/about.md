I'm a 27 year old jr Data Scientist & jr Data Engineer pursuing my 
masters in Data Science and Statistics. I currently work at TheOrthopedicReview as a Junior Data Engineer. 

My interests are primarily in statistical learning theory, 
probabilistic generative models, machine learning 
algorithms/optimization, data mining and database design.

I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL. I'm most comfortable using R for 
statistical analyses and Python for training ML models. I'm currently
getting the hang of putting these models into production using scikitLearn.  

I will be entering the Data Science MSc program at Montclair State University in September 2020.
