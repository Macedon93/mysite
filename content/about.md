I'm a 27 year old Jr Data Engineer at The Orthopedic Review. Im currently pursuing my 
MSc in Machine Learning at Stevens Institute of Technology.  

My interests are primarily in statistical learning theory, 
probabilistic generative models, optimization techniques, and GAN applied to financial markets.

I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL. I'm most comfortable using R for 
statistical analyses and Python for training ML models. I'm currently
getting the hang of putting these models into production using scikitLearn.
